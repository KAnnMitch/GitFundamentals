# git status 

The command `git status` is extremely helpful when it comes to checking on the status of your repository. It is exactly what it sounds like, a status check. 
Status is a command that is safe to use at any time. If you want to see what is going on it's good to use `git status` in between commands until you get to know the flow better. 
```
git add . 
git status 
git commit -m "modified landing page"
git push 
```
